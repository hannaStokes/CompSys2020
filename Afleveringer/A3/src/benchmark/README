The benchmarks are provided in the form of 3 hexfiles, which are to be
simulated with different inputs. You are not allowed to change the hexfiles.

All benchmarks sort a set of random integers. The size of the set is
given as parameter.

The "run-performance.sh" script will run all desired combinations of
programs and inputs.

The "C"-code from which the hexfiles have been generated are provided
in the subdirectory "c_reference_sources" for information. But understanding
the programs are not required to solve the assignment.
